Implement code by following the CODE_IMPLOSION guidelines: completely delete any existing implementation and rebuild from scratch using a fundamentally sound, first‑principles approach that avoids all legacy issues.

code_implosion_guidelines:
  - principle: "Drop the Old Foundations"
    description: "Wipe out all existing code to eliminate recurring flaws and ensure no legacy issues carry over."
  - principle: "Rebuild from First Principles"
    description: "Design every component from the ground up, basing solutions only on core requirements and sound design concepts."
  - principle: "Zero‑Dependency Baseline"
    description: "Begin with no external libraries beyond the absolute essentials, and add each dependency only when clearly justified."
  - principle: "Sound Architectural Blueprint"
    description: "Define a clear module/interface structure and data flow before writing any code to guarantee robustness and maintainability."
  - principle: "Iterative Verification"
    description: "After each foundational piece is implemented, immediately test and validate its behavior in isolation before proceeding."
