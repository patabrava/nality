Implement code by following the CODE_CONTRACTION guidelines to adopt a fresh approach and break out of repetitive patterns.

CODE_CONTRACTION
```yaml
---
code_modification_guidelines:
  - principle: "Seek Alternative Solutions"
    description: "When encountering repetitive loops or ineffective approaches, actively search for different methodologies or algorithms to solve the problem."
  - principle: "Innovate and Diversify"
    description: "Encourage the use of innovative techniques and diverse strategies to overcome obstacles and enhance code functionality."
  - principle: "Break Existing Patterns"
    description: "Identify and move away from ineffective or redundant coding patterns that hinder progress, adopting new structures as needed."
  - principle: "Encourage Creativity"
    description: "Foster creative problem-solving by exploring unconventional methods and thinking outside the box to achieve desired outcomes."
  - principle: "Avoid Redundancy"
    description: "Ensure that new code additions do not replicate existing functionalities unnecessarily, promoting efficiency and clarity."
